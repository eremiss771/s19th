            <h1>Happy 19th Birthday, Sara!</h1>
            <p>From the moment we met, you’ve been my light in the darkness. I was lost, struggling, and feeling like I was drowning in the emptiness of my mind. But then, there you were, pulling me out, piece by piece, with your kindness, your strength, and your unwavering support.</p>
            <p>I love you to the moon and back—maybe even more. You are my unbiological twin, my most favorite person in the history of humans, and the most beautiful soul I’ve ever known. You’re the one who has seen me at my lowest, yet you’ve always pushed me to rise higher.</p>
            <p>Even when I doubt myself, or sometimes even doubt if you feel the same, I never doubt that you’re the most incredible person I’ve ever met. I’m so lucky to have you in my life, and today, on your 19th birthday, I want you to know how much you mean to me.</p>
            <p class="heart">❤️</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday, maemrek ateerfi tkhayli shehal kanbghik.</p>
